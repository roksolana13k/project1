    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diana Prince, we’ve been waiting for you.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wonder Woman</i> is a departure from most superhero films you’ve seen. It's a female superhero film — <b>which<br/>
    is revolutionary enough by itself</b> — but it's also a genuinely surprising film that plays with genre and throws<br/> 
    out the now very tired superhero movie formula. It’s an action film, a romantic comedy and a coming-of-age<br/>
    story and a period piece and a war movie all in one. Above all, it’s a hopeful story about humanity.<br/>
    
    <p>
        <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonder Woman</em> is the best movie Marvel rival DC Comics has put out in its own cinematic universe, and<br/>
        unlike the recent parade of bleak superhero tales from both studios, it makes you feel good while you watch it.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The film, set in World War I, takes us back to the beginning of Diana’s (Gal Gadot) story, showing her growing<br/>
        up on the island of Themyscira, an all-female paradise that's home to the Amazons. When American pilot Steve<br/>
        Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes there, his description of the devastation of the Great War compels Diana to leave and<br/>
        help fight.

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Themyscira sequences are beautiful to look at and include an adorable young Diana, the movie truly<br/>
        begins to sing when she and Steve begin their adventure. Gadot and Pine have fantastic chemistry and Pine does well<br/>
        as the audience surrogate, displaying appropriate amusement and curiosity at Diana’s strange ways.

    <small>Chris Pine stars as Steve Trevor, an American pilot and spy who recruits Wonder Woman to help end WWI.</small>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diana is genuine in her love for ice cream. She and the film are genuine about everything,which is what makes it<br/>
         feel so special. In a time when the public discourse is fraught and full of misinformation and hatred, watching Wonder<br/>
          Woman fight so hard and so earnestly for love is a profound experience.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard not to feel, well, <i>wonderful</i>.
